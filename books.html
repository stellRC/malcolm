As he illustrates the results of Americaâ€™s military adventuring, Garcia not only takes us to the physical space of the people who are the victims of our drone attacks, our bombs, and our bullets, but he also goes where few nonfiction writers have the skill to ventureâ€”he takes us inside their heads.</blockquote>
