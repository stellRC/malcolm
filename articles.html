                                <p>A scrim of dust hovers above the alley and drains the light, turning this December afternoon into dusk long before sunset. Peter and I walk to a rotted wood door that leads us into a corridor of mud and clay. Moving slowly, we crouch beneath a slumped brick walk that spans a narrow passageway and walk past bearded old men, foul smelling and ragged, who squat amid caged birds. The birds' desperate high-pitched songs follow us deeper inside, past the dirt-smeared faces of boys who leer at us, like shadows against the walls. We keep walking toward a blanket behind which rise the shouts of men.</p>

I asked him how he could vote, since no one under 18 was eligible. He had a simple explanation. The village elder called a meeting and announced his support for Karzai, commanding that all the people should vote for him, too. Then he contacted representatives of the voting commission to come to the village and register the people. Although Ahmad is sixteen, the village elder said he and many other teenagers were eighteen.</p>

He lay on a cot in the front office of the Deported Veterans Support House, a nonprofit that stands next to an auto mechanic shop and a karaoke bar and assists veterans removed from the United States. Pizza joints and convenience stores lined the main drag, less than half a block away. At night, dogs roamed the streets, toppling garbage cans. An American flag concealed the glass front door.</p>

                                The survivors of sex trafficking had been accepted into Magdalene St. Louis, a program that helps women live free from abuse, addiction and prostitution.

They responded, seeking assurance that they would really be living in a safe, loving place. They did not believe it was possible, Leigh said.</p>

                                    Rhode Island prison inmate Steven Parkhurst gives his rap, sees the students who should be listening strutting their stuff on one side of the visiting room. Swaggering, holding court. Oh, yeah, Steven thinks. There’s me at their age. Think they’re tough. This ain’t shit. This is a field trip.

                                <p>Marr wanted an instrument with a design similar to an 18th-century French bass. He liked its look — the elegantly cut scrolls and f-holes and sloping shoulders. It was also smaller and easier to play. Millard designed it. Marr’s shop, set up for furniture, had the equipment to cut the board. Since meeting in 1980, they had hung out and played in bands together. But they had never taken on a project like this.</p>

Carrying a saxophone case in one hand and a satchel stuffed with songbooks in the other, she walks toward a piano, greeting patients as they eat lunch. Unpacking her saxophone, Forman runs a hand over the piano keys. A few of the agency’s patients gravitate toward her. One complains he ate too much.</p>

If a child liked turtles, she could recommend two or three books on the subject. She reached even the most reluctant student because she knew so many books.</p>

Granny’s eyes would be closed, mouth open a crack. She wore tennis shoes and at least three socks on each foot. Long underwear showed beneath the hem of her dress, and a wool cap covered her gray hair. The handwritten cardboard sign around her neck — HELP THE HOMELESS — made passersby pause. </p>

                        <p>The other week when I followed a dirt path in an industrial area of Kansas City, Missouri known as the West Bottoms, I found a kitten. Or, I should say, it found me. The trail twisted around trees and over rusted train tracks and past a camp of homeless army veterans. I was a reporter writing a story about federal budget cuts in programs for homeless veterans for The Kansas City Star. I wanted to ask them what they thought of the reductions.</p>

                        <p>Daniela can’t stand Lisa. Exactly why, I’m not sure. I can see her criticizing Lisa, who is her boss, but Daniela’s anger goes well beyond mere criticism. I suspect her rage stems in part from their age difference: Lisa is twenty-nine. Daniela, I assume, is in her late fifties like me, and she’s been at this Big Box store for five years to Lisa’s two. And Lisa looks like a teenager, with her oversized sunglasses, bob haircut, and perpetual pout.</p>

                        <p>Here’s a Malcolm and Kevin story: The year is 1982. Kevin and I drive into St. Louis from Columbia, Missouri. He wants to show me where he grew up and shot dope. We manoeuvre through road construction on I-70 east, exit onto one highway and then another until we pull off onto a residential street lined on either side by small brick one-story homes with wraparound porches and spotless yards. I was expecting decay and boarded-up buildings. This feels almost like a picture on a postcard. After a moment, however, I notice the security bars over windows and the heavy iron gates protecting doors. We pass a house where a man in dark sunglasses watches us from a porch. Kevin tells me to park.</p>

                        <p> The woman brushes a lank strand of gray hair from her face and cups the feather in her hand. She wants to talk, he thinks. Why else would she have asked him about a feather?  He hopes the bus arrives soon. The silence and his conviction she wants to speak make him uneasy. He’s used to his own company.  Well, what do you think we should do this afternoon? he’ll ask himself. The sound of his voice breaks the solitude of his apartment and the ears of his dog perk up and then relax. Like an undertow, the silence that follows the unanswered question pulls everything with it until all that is left is his hope that something in the ether––spirits, energy, he has heard various notions––was listening.</p>

                        <p>Hafez and I have been friends since childhood. My daughter, Asal, married Hafez’s son, Raziah, a police officer. After the Americans defeated the Taliban and we were allowed to take photographs again, Hafez bought a small digital camera. Over the years he took so many pictures of Raziah. Too many. Raziah as a baby, Raziah playing fútbol, Raziah graduating from the police academy. Enough pictures, I would tell Hafez. I have known your son since he was born. I don’t need to see his pictures. Hafez would laugh. He is my only son, he would say. I am too proud of him. I love my three daughters but Raziah will carry my name and my father’s name. Do you not see me in his face? he would ask, showing me yet another photo.</p>
